## Hi there 👋


I'm Gabriela - Curious Learner
I'm not a programmer, but I'm here to learn more about technology.
Through GitHub, I hope to learn how to use digital tools that can help me in my field of work, as well as create simple projects.
If you'd like to send me tips, contact me via email gabrielarsartor@gmail.com or Instagram @brugabirs.

Recent achievements:

I love: cats, books, design, and learning more every day.
